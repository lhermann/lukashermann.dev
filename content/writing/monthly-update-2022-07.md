## Launching Stagetimer on Product Hunt

It was a dark and stormy night. The kind of night that made you want to stay inside with a good book and a cup of tea. But I had a job to do. I was brooding over my new product, ready to take it to the masses.

I was launching my product on Product Hunt, and I had to make sure everything went off without a hitch. I had been planning and preparing for this day for months, and I wasn't about to let anything ruin it.

As I logged into Product Hunt, I could feel the excitement building inside of me. This was it. The moment of truth.

With a few clicks of a button, the product is live on Product Hunt, and the race to the top of the leaderboard begins.

I know that success on Product Hunt requires more than just a great product ‚Äì it takes a bit of luck, timing, and a whole lot of hustle. But I also know that the rewards can be great, and so I put my all into making this product a success.

But in the back of my mind, I couldn't help but wonder... what if something goes wrong? What if my product isn't as good as I think it is?

For the next 24 hours, I will be glued to my screen, promoting the product, answering questions, and doing whatever it takes to get it to the top. It's a tough battle, but they're determined to come out on top.

The minutes ticked by slowly, but eventually the first upvotes started rolling in. And then the comments.

People were liking my product!

The day went on, the momentum kept building.

As Product Hunt launch day was coming to a close. The final hours were ticking away and the tension was mounting. I was on edge, ready to pounce on any last-minute issues.

By the end of the day, my product was in the #1 spot on Product Hunt.

It was a huge success. And it all went off without a hitch.

I couldn't have been more thrilled. It was a dream come true.

The product had been successfully launched, and I was feeling good about my accomplishment. I toasted to my success and collected congratulations on Twitter for a job well done.

But in the back of my mind, I knew that this was only the beginning. The real work was just beginning. I had to continue to market the product, and make sure that it was a success in the long run.

But for now, I was content to enjoy my moment of triumph.

I'm glancing over to the desk beside me. Of course, I could have only done all this with the help of my co-founder, the kind of woman who knows what she wants, and how to get it.

She is beautiful, but there is something about her that is hard to define. She is smart, but there is an edge to her that is dangerous. She is the kind of woman who could have anything she wants, and she wants Stagetimer to be a success.

She's got a sharp mind and a sharp tongue, and she knows how to use both to get what she wants.

And she is my wife.

She was still up late, poring over the AdWords campaign she had set up. She was tweaking this and that, making sure that her ads were as effective as they could be. She was determined to succeed.

She was so focused on her task that she didn't hear the footsteps behind her until it was too late. She turned around just in time to see me giving her a big kiss.

We made it. Product of the Day!

## We're going on a digital nomad year!

As a young couple, we are excited to embark on our digital nomad year! We have been preparing by saving money, researching our options and making a plan. We are both co-founders of a SaaS business and will be working online as we travel. We are excited to see the world and experience new cultures while still being able to earn a living.

We have already booked our flights and have a list of places we want to visit. We are excited to explore new countries and experience new things together. We are also excited to meet other digital nomads and learn from their experiences.

We are confident that we can make this work and are looking forward to an amazing year ahead!

## Oh, and we also launched a candy store ...

... kind of üòÖ

One day my wife Liz and I visited a candy store in our neighborhood. We came for the candy, but we left intrigued that all the other customers were adults! The joy of adults in a candy store is like a kid in a candy store, but with more money to spend and no parental supervision. It's a place where you can indulge in your sweet tooth without guilt or shame, and where the only thing that matters is the sugar high.

So we thought, can we turn this experience into an online business?

I'm presenting: https://ohcandyworld.com/ (a prototype)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Working on the MVP for a candy store. The shopping experience should be as delightful as being a child in the candy store.<br><br>No search, no filters, no list, pure curious discovery üç≠ <a href="https://t.co/TdCXlbumgl">pic.twitter.com/TdCXlbumgl</a></p>&mdash; Lukas Hermann (@_lhermann) <a href="https://twitter.com/_lhermann/status/1520518951461081088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The main aspect of being an adult in a candy store is the joy of discovery. So we built completely unlike a traditional e-commerce store. Instead of easily searchable and filterable lists, we created a Google Maps-like experience where you move around and discover candy.

The prototype is pretty nice, but we quickly discovered that the interface is a bit too bare-bones. Firstly, we need some way to explain what this actually is. Secondly, the UI is a bit bare. It needs better product descriptions and preview images so people know what they are actually buying.

But what we definitely achieved was the AHA! effect and the glee of clicking on candies and seeing them "POP" into the candy jar üòÑ

By now, the project is on hold until we return from the nomad year.
