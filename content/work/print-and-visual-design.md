This collection serves less as space to show off and more as a archive of fond memories. There are beaturiful expressions of creativity and some dorky designs that are connected to nice memories. This is a place to enjoy.

## 2D Image Manipulation

These are products of a Photoshop contest. In every case, a stock image was provided and the result was judged by the community based on creativity and execution.

Orrery is a model of our solar system driven by a clockwork-like mechanism. The stock image was the pocket watch, without the transparency and gears. I always had a fascination with space and other worlds.

Bulbworld is, as can be surmised by the title, a tiny world in a lightbulb. The lightbulb was the stock image provided. I still remember getting a real lightbulb and holding it against my window in a thousand different ways to recreate the most photorealistic reflections on the glass.

Guitar Manual may look a bit bland. The provided stock was a top-down picture of the guitar. My inspiration was [this Team Fortress 2 art](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sandvich/de#/media/File:Meetthesandvich4.PNG) showing the building instructions for a benign sandwich in the style of a vintage-looking metal plaque advertisement. I especially love the outlined breakdown of the guitar and the small details at the bottom with specially crafted logos in the style of the time.

## 3D Renders with Cinema4D

I gave myself the challenge to recreate simple real-world objects as faithful as possible. The fun part was to tweak the different surface materials until they felt just right.

These two buildings were created for a harbor scene as part of a 3D artist contest. I really like the video game feel of these models. They won the contest.

This work in progress render of a futuristic space ship comes with a turret animation. Even though the animation is very simple I had great fun tweaking it until it felt just right inconveying the mass and recoil of each shot.
