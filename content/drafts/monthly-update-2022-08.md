## We're going on a digital nomad year!

As a young couple, we are excited to embark on our digital nomad year! We have been preparing by saving money, researching our options and making a plan. We are both co-founders of a SaaS business and will be working online as we travel. We are excited to see the world and experience new cultures while still being able to earn a living.

We have already booked our flights and have a list of places we want to visit. We are excited to explore new countries and experience new things together. We are also excited to meet other digital nomads and learn from their experiences.

We are confident that we can make this work and are looking forward to an amazing year ahead!

## Oh, and we also launched a candy store ...

... kind of üòÖ

One day my wife Liz and I visited a candy store in our neighborhood. We came for the candy, but we left intrigued that all the other customers were adults! The joy of adults in a candy store is like a kid in a candy store, but with more money to spend and no parental supervision. It's a place where you can indulge in your sweet tooth without guilt or shame, and where the only thing that matters is the sugar high.

So we thought, can we turn this experience into an online business?

I'm presenting: https://ohcandyworld.com/ (a prototype)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Working on the MVP for a candy store. The shopping experience should be as delightful as being a child in the candy store.<br><br>No search, no filters, no list, pure curious discovery üç≠ <a href="https://t.co/TdCXlbumgl">pic.twitter.com/TdCXlbumgl</a></p>&mdash; Lukas Hermann (@_lhermann) <a href="https://twitter.com/_lhermann/status/1520518951461081088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The main aspect of being an adult in a candy store is the joy of discovery. So we built completely unlike a traditional e-commerce store. Instead of easily searchable and filterable lists, we created a Google Maps-like experience where you move around and discover candy.

The prototype is pretty nice, but we quickly discovered that the interface is a bit too bare-bones. Firstly, we need some way to explain what this actually is. Secondly, the UI is a bit bare. It needs better product descriptions and preview images so people know what they are actually buying.

But what we definitely achieved was the AHA! effect and the glee of clicking on candies and seeing them "POP" into the candy jar üòÑ

By now, the project is on hold until we return from the nomad year.
