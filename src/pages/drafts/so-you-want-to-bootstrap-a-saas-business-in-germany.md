> Do you know or can you recommend any tax advisor, who could take on nebenberufliche Gewerbe? (I do speak German so language is not relevant).
>
> Most of the ones I search either don't know what SaaS is or don't want to take another client.

I looked on Google for a local one and then picked the one with the most stars and least gray hair. I'm from a small town, so had no problems.

But if you sell digital services/products, I'd just use the tax advisor service from Lexoffice or Kontist. Also the cheapest option by far.


> I really don't want to my home address into the impressum. It is my mortgaged property, so I can't just move to another flat.
>
> I know it is prohibited to have a PO box as business address, so I thought maybe is it possible to have a virtual one? Do you have any experience with that?

Honestly just put your address there. Nobody cares. See https://stagetimer.io/imprint/.
Conversely, I didn't put any address (only name and email) for the first 2 years and nobody cared as well.

If you are very concerned you can get a business address from co-working spaces for a few Euros per month.


> You advocate for MoR like LemonSqueezy, but is it ok if I start with Stripe and if the sales are coming in I will switch to MoR?

Of course you can start with Stripe. The only threshold you really have to keep an eye on is the 10,000 EUR selling-to-other-EU-countries VAT-free limit. The rest is, let's say, more of a suggestion.


> Do I actually need a Geschaftskonto in the beginning? 

No. If you have an Einzelunternehmer you can use anything. You own bank account, Wise, even PayPal. But it does make accounting MUCH easier to have a separate bank account.


> Any other advice to what I should pay attention? Just general (besides what you mention in your blog).

Yes. Know your taxes. Be aware that you have to make advanced VAT payments and pay income tax at the end of the year. Don't make the mistake other new business owners do and spend it all and then go bankrupt. I use Kontist for my business bank account and they have a nice feature where they calculate you taxes and show you how much of the money you can use vs. how much you should reserve for taxes.
