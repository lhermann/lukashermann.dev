Monthly Update January 2022: $6,500 MRR plans

I'm the product owner of AIRD

What do I mean by AIRD?

Aird is the project name for a new service that we're building. At this stage, it's still confidential so we can't share too much about the details of what it'll be (but trust me, you'll hear a lot more in the coming months). For now, let's just say that AIRD will be an exciting new way to make money from your character cards, and will help players grow their packs and progress through the game.

As Product Owner of AIRD, my primary focus over the month was defining user stories for version one.

Taxes suck

Taxes suck. We know this. And since you're a Saas company like us, you probably feel the pain even more than most people do. It's just something that comes with the territory, but the good news is that it's not as bad as you think it is—at least, it won't be once we've walked you through it.

First off, taxes are complicated and we aren't tax experts. We strongly recommend hiring a tax accountant who can help you navigate your specific business' legal requirements to ensure that you are complying with all of them and paying in a timely manner to avoid penalties and late fees. However, there are some general points worth noting. The tax code is expansive and intricate; it makes sense to remember that the tax laws keep changing and so will your obligations to pay them. Most importantly: taxes are unfair—and they suck!

All kidding aside: yes, taxes do suck—but they're also an unfortunate necessity without which our society wouldn’t function properly, so don't let them get in your way or stress you out too much!

Yearly planning for Stagetimer

This is a monthly update from me on what we're doing. It's an open article where I share our progress, plans and thoughts about Stagetimer. After that I give a short update about the team, blog and marketing.

We have great customers

You may be wondering how we could be seeing such an increase in sales, and it really boils down to you all. As we’ve said many times before, our customers are hands down the best part of this business.

Not only are you helping us grow into a better product, but you’re also sharing your love for Unsplurge with others so that they can benefit from this product as well. Nothing makes our day like hearing that you shared Unsplurge with a friend or family member who has struggled to save money and is now doing so successfully thanks to Unsplurge!
