## Registering a Company

- What’s the simplest way to legally start a SaaS business in Germany?
- What company type should I use?

There are lots of different company types in Germany. But only three are really interesting to us: Sole Proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen), UG and GmbH.

My advice is simple, start without a company. Build your MVP, launch it for free, get your first users and validate that your idea has legs. Then, before implementing a payment solution, register a Sole Proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen).

Many people will advice you to get a GmbH, and they are right. A GmbH is great, it limits your liability and protects your personal bank account when you get sued. But it comes with a price tag. For one, the €25,000 initical capital requirement (You can get started with €12,500 or go for an UG with same benefits and €1 minimum capital requirement). But also a more complex accounting. This means your tax advisor is going to cost you minimum €2,500 per year.

But you are building a SaaS business, not a service agency. An agency closes contracts of thens of thousands of Euros. You sell your service for $8 per month. You won't sign SLA's for years. Your ToS, that customers agree to, will say that they can't make you liable for damage if your service goes down.

In short, the risk as SaaS owner is low. The running cost of a GmbH is high. Your greatest enemy at the start is high running costs. Ergo, use a Sole Proprietorship and save on accounting. THen upgrade to a GmbH when you reach €60,000 yearly revenue.

1. Sole Proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen)
  - What it is: It's the simplest form of business in Germany. If you're working alone and start a business, by default, you're an Einzelunternehmer (sole proprietor).
  - Key Features:
    - Ownership: Just you. You own, run, and are responsible for everything.
    - Taxes: You pay personal income tax on your profits, not corporate tax.
    - Liability: There's no distinction between your personal and business assets. If your business owes money, your personal assets (like your car or house) could be used to pay debts.

2. Limited Liability Company without Minimum Capital (UG)
  - What it is: Often called a "mini-GmbH," it's a form of limited liability company designed to be more accessible to startups.
  - Key Features:
    - Ownership: Can be one or more people. The UG is its own legal entity.
    - Taxes: Pays corporate tax, trade tax, and dividends are subject to capital gains tax.
    - Liability: Your personal assets are generally protected. Liability is limited to the company's assets.
    - Capital: Requires a minimum share capital of €1 (but saving towards the €25,000 required for a GmbH is encouraged).

3. Limited Liability Company with €25,000 Minimum Capital (GmbH)
  - What it is: The most common form of a private limited company in Germany.
  - Key Features:
    - Ownership: Can be founded by one or more people. The GmbH is a separate legal entity.
    - Taxes: Similar to the UG, it pays corporate tax, trade tax, and dividends are taxed.
    - Liability: Owners are not personally liable for the company's debts; liability is limited to the company's assets.
    - Capital: Requires a minimum share capital of €25,000, half of which must be paid up when the company is registered.

^[1] Getting paid is another caveat. As Sole Proprietor all profit is yours and taxed as income tax. As GmbH you need to pay yourself a salary, meaning you need payroll accounting (Lohnbuchhaltung) and you have to document every salary adjustment with a signed paper. It sounds silly, but you have to literally write it down and then sign it twice, once as managing director and then as employee.
