In this Starter Story video, I share how I built a simple app that now generates $25,000/month. The story covers everything from validating the idea on Reddit to running the business with my wife, and why people are willing to pay for what seems like a simple timer tool.

> **@glowshedfilms**: *"Nice to see a more sincere relatable story and less of the click bait. Also notice you seem to be posting more frequently! Thats cool :)"*

> **@ahmettavsan293**: *"This guy's journey is such a reminder that it's never too late to change direction, stop procrastinating, and take control of your life. If he can turn things around like this, it makes me believe I can do the same. I can't wait to see what he launches in 30 days. Keep going, man! You're crushing it!"*

> **@user-mx1oc4rr5f**: *"Great real story, no exaggerated claims about making $1M in 15 min"*

> **@paul7439**: *"As a German myself totally can relate to the ending words of Lukas. Although I have to admit fear is not totally gone yet hahaha. I started my first micro saas in the music production space 2 month ago. Switched from free trial to direct subscription and got my first 2 paying customer without any marketing. Feels incredible ðŸŽ‰"*
