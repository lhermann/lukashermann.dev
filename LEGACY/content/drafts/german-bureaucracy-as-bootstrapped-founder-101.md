=========

When faced with bureaucracy you have two options: Despair or get the hang of it. Germany bureaucracy is formidable, so is US bureaucracy[^9]. The disadvantage we Germans have: ours will slap you in the face right away. There’s not much “flying under the radar”. When you start a company you’re gonna get hit by overwhelming paperwork fast. In this article I'll show the path of least resistance to get a digital product to market.

Table of Contents:

1. When and how to register a company
2. Taxes, briefly
3. The Cost of Doing Business in Germany
4. How to handle accounting, affordably
5. What to put in your T&C, Privacy Policy, etc.
6. How to collect money online and pass a tax inspection

Disclaimer: This article is from the perspective of a profitable bootstrapped company, mine. You won't find any advice on getting government grants or venture-capital, nor any crying or complaining about how difficult German bureaucracy is. If it were easy, you wouldn't be reading this. So let's get started.

# Who is the enemy?

Is it high taxes? Or the amount of paperwork? Or potential lawsuits? Or high service fees?

At first it’s the paperwork. Germany is the Dark Souls of entrepreneurship, but without the tutorial section. Start the game, already face the first boss: "Fragebogen zur Steuerlichen Erfassung”. Seriously, it’s crazy how many things are mandatory here that you are just assumed to know. We’ll fix that.

Next, is high service fees. In the first year, you’ll likely pay way more money to your tax advisor than you pay in actual taxes. These costs are real, everybody has them, and we’ll learn how to keep them manageable.

And then, only once you reached self-sustaining amounts of revenue, will taxes eat up most of your monetary cake. Until then, however, you’ll be able to afford a tax advisor who’ll do a good job. No need to worry about that right now.

The US and other countries often solve problems in litigation after-the-fact. Germany, and Europe in general, solves problems through regulation in an attempt to avoid them beforehand. There's pros and cons to both. As a rule of thumb: A new company in Germany struggles with regulations and can mostly ignore the threat of lawsuits at first.

# 1. When, How and Where to Register a Company

Question we’ll answer here:
- What’s the simplest way to legally start a SaaS business in Germany?
- What company type should I use?
- Is it easier to incorporate abroad?
- What if I’m employed full-time and want to start a side gig?
- Can I start a business as foreigner?
- Is it expensive to close a company, I heard stories?
- Do I need a Holding Company?

Do I actually need a company?

Yes. You can earn money as either an employee or as a company. The gray area in between is either very slim or reserved for specific service jobs like dentists or engineering consultants.

Two German institutions in particular want to know your revenue, the tax office (Finanzamt) and the health insurance (Krankenversicherung). The former will request taxes and the latter charges social security premiums. Lying to them or even putting off your disclosure responsibility is not advisable. Ask me how I know.

Having said that, it's not a bad idea to scale to your first €200/month under the radar. Right after company formation you'll be hit with some mandatory running costs (see section below) that can be a bit disheartening when you start with zero revenue.

What Type of Company?

There are lots of different company types in Germany. But only three are really interesting to us: Sole Proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen) [^1], UG [^2] and GmbH [^3]. There’s also a “Freiberufler”, but that won’t apply to you [^4].

My advice is simple, start without a company. Build your MVP, launch it for free, get your first users and validate that your idea has legs. Then, before implementing a payment solution, register a Sole Proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen).

Many people will advise you to get a GmbH, and they are right. A GmbH is great, it limits your liability and protects your personal bank account when you get sued. But it comes with a price tag. For one, the €25,000 initial capital requirement (You can get started with €12,500 or go for an UG with same benefits and €1 minimum capital requirement). But also a more complex accounting. This means your tax advisor is going to cost you minimum €2,500 per year [^5].

But you are building a SaaS business, not a service agency. An agency closes contracts of thens of thousands of Euros. You sell your service for $8 per month [^6]. You won't sign SLA's for years. Your ToS, that customers agree to, will say that they can't make you liable for damage if your service goes down.

In short, the risk as SaaS owner is low. The running cost of a GmbH is high. Your greatest enemy at the beginning is high running costs. Ergo, use a Sole Proprietorship and save on accounting. Then upgrade to a GmbH when you reach €60,000 yearly revenue.

But what if I get sued? You won't. You are in Germany. Your real nemesis, as you will learn quickly, is the Finanzamt (aka. the taxman). If you mess up your taxes and reporting, they're gonna send you letters, then warnings, then fees and then seize your bank account. You'll be liable for taxes with life and limb, GmbH or not, limited liability does not protect from tax obligations. I've never been sued, but I got plenty of those letters. Ask any first-time entrepreneur in Germany and chances are you'll hear a similar story.

And one more German fun fact: Closing a GmbH is expensive! It takes over a year and comes with multiple regulatory steps. It's even more difficult than starting a company (hard to believe, I know!) and can easily cost you €6,000. So until that amount is pocket change for you, go with a sole proprietor that's trivial to close.

Incorporating Abroad?

Apparently everyone and their dog has an LLC in the UK or Singapore. Why not skip all that German trouble?

You and me, we think the same. In 2019 I received the Estonian e-Citizenship and became the proud founder of a shiny Estonian OÜ. It was like traveling into the future, everything was done with electronic signatures. No, not those PDF signers with squiggly pictures of pixelated signatures, I’m talking card reader connected to the laptop and cryptographically signed documents. My contact company xolo.io (“Leap In” back then) had my business up and running in days, all ready to write invoices baby.

You can probably tell this story didn’t have a happy ending.

Turns out the law doesn’t want people to avoid taxes. The rule therefore is, wherever you work, that’s where you are taxed, and wherever a company makes its decisions, that’s where it is taxed. Now I was left with four options:
1. I could fly to Tallinn for every executive decision about my business.
2. I could lie about flying to Tallinn.
3. I could move from country to country every fewer than 180 days per year and become the elusive “perpetual traveler”.
4. Or I could bite the bullet and get taxed in Germany with my Estonian company.

Now, if you are a digital nomad, options #3 is actually realistic. But you may just postpone the problem to the day when you get tired of traveling. I went for option #4. It was not fun. I had to do the same expensive accounting like a German GmbH in addition to all the compliance and accounting in Estonia. It was not worth it and I closed the company. In fact, I've just paid the (hopefully) last German tax advisor fee for closing that company in Estonia in 2021! Fun times...


Incorporating as a Foreigner?

I'd lie if I pretended to know how. As a native German I never faced this question. Instead, I refer you to this amazing guide: How to apply for a German freelance visa

In essence, you'll need a freelance visa or Blue Card that permits self-employment (Selbständige Tätigkeit gestattet).

Registering a Company, Step by Step

This is the tutorial section, the one you should have had in school, but never did for some reason. This is how you, a normal person, can end up with an actual legal company to write invoices and get money.

Step 1:

Go to the website of your local city government and look for the business registration form (Gewerbeanmeldung). Most cities should have an online process by now. Here's a great resource to guide you through the process in Berlin: https://allaboutberlin.com/glossary/Gewerbeanmeldung

It's usually advised to get help from a tax advisor, but you can do it alone. Here in Stuttgart I got an appointment, brought a printout, and they helped me tick the right boxes. The legal entity is a sole proprietor company (Einzelunternehmen) and will run under your own name.

There's a small processing fee of €15.

Step 2:

A few days later (depending how busy, maybe a few weeks later) you'll get a letter with your trade license (Gewerbeschein). Congratulations, you can now do business!

Keep this document save, you'll need it for sensitive stuff like opening a business bank account.

Step 3:

The Gewerbeanmeldung is not the only step to start a business. You must also register your business at the Finanzamt.

...

Step 4:

Avoid Scams. As a sole proprietor company you only have mandatory obligations with the following institutions (for more on these see the section below):
- Local tax office
- Health care provider
- IHK (aka. Industrie- und Handelskammer)
- GEZ (aka. ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice)

You can safely ignore all other cries for money that arrive at your doorstep in form of invoice letters, they are scams. Admittedly this problem is a bit more prevalent when founding a GmbH because it comes with some more mandatory steps that can easily be confusing for newcomers.

If you are curious about the same process for a GmbH, then I'll refer you to this handy guide with only slightly negative undertones: https://eidel.io/how-to-found-a-company-in-germany-14-easy-steps-and-lots-of-pain/

# 3. The Cost of Doing Business in Germany

While insignificant in the long run, the following are tax-unrelated mandatory costs of doing business in Germany and can hit you hard initially if you are not prepared.

Health Insurance

Germany has a mandatory health insurance system. Every employee has health insurance, paid 50% by the employer and 50% by the employee. The regular worker's only choice is between some relatively similar public providers with ever so slightly higher or lower premiums. Premiums are always a percentage of income.

That is, unless you are un- or self employed, you'll need a health provider, and you'll pay 100% of it. (Yes, even unemployed people are required to have health insurance, but not our topic.) You, as new business owner, have the choice between private and public health insurance. For young singles, private insurance appears much cheaper, but I've heard entrepreneurs regret picking private because it gets expensive with family and age.[^8] It then requires some regulatory acrobatics to switch back to the public system. Thus, public insurance may be preferable until you "made it". (It's called "voluntary insurance", but don't be fooled, it's only voluntary in that you choose public over private.)

But public health insurance comes with one major drawback: The premium is a percentage of your profit, but assumes a minimum of ~€1200/month and maxes out at ~€5200/month. Meaning your insurance premium is at least €187/month (16.2%), even if your revenue is lower than that![^7]

So unless you already have insurance through a full-time job, plan accordingly.

IHK

Don't ask women their age, a man his salary, or the IHK what value they provide. IHK roughly translates to "chamber of commerce" and are essentially a leftover from the olden days. Anyway, you'll have to pay them _at least_ €153/year. The sooner you get over it and pay, the less energy you'll waste.

As a new business, you can ask the IHK to waive the fee the first two years: https://www.ihk.de/stuttgart/ueber-uns/ihk-arbeit/ihk-transparent/beitrag/wie-hoch-ist-der-ihk-beitrag-fuer-existenzgruender-683338

GEZ

The GEZ is a mandatory €18.36/month subscription for public TV and radio. It's the part where Germany slaps socialism squarely across your face. You don't have a TV and don't listen to radio? Me neither. In fact, apart from my parents, I don't know anyone who does. Doesn't matter, we're paying for this right to complain about it to all your German friends. Fortunately the fee is per household, so you can wiggle out of it if someone at your address already pays.

# 4. How to handle accounting, affordably
- How should I handle bookkeeping, taxes, and expenses early on?
- Do I need a business bank account?
- Can you recommend any tax advisor?
- Let's talk about VAT.
- What happens if you don’t submit tax reports?

Finding a Tax Advisor / Accountant

i: In Germany tax advisors (Steuerberater) and accountants (Buchhalter) are almost synonymous, I'll use accountant from heron out.

If I had one nickel for every person that asks me if I know a good accountant, I'd have a nickel every week.

It's almost an offense how hard it is to find a good accountant. It's even difficult to find one at all. It comes down to a painful chicken-and-egg problem for new businesses: Most accountants only accept clients who make EUR 100k revenue or more annually, but as founder you should have an accountant before you make even your first Euro. In my eyes this is the biggest obstacle for startups in Germany, more than the high taxes, the paperwork or even the confused looks of your German relatives.

# 5. What to put in your T&C, Privacy Policy, etc.

Terms of Service
- Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen or AGB in German

GDPR and Privacy Policy
- Datenschutz-Grundverordnung or DSGVO in German
- GDPR, briefly.

Impressum
- I really don't want to my home address into the impressum.

Footnotes

[^1] Sole Proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen)
  - What it is: It's the simplest form of business in Germany. If you're working alone and start a business, by default, you're an Einzelunternehmer (sole proprietor).
  - Key Features:
    - Ownership: Just you. You own, run, and are responsible for everything.
    - Taxes: You pay personal income tax on your profits, not corporate tax.
    - Liability: There's no distinction between your personal and business assets. If your business owes money, your personal assets (like your car or house) could be used to pay debts.

[^2] Limited Liability Company without Minimum Capital (UG)
  - What it is: Often called a "mini-GmbH," it's a form of limited liability company designed to be more accessible to startups.
  - Key Features:
    - Ownership: Can be one or more people. The UG is its own legal entity.
    - Taxes: Pays corporate tax, trade tax, and dividends are subject to capital gains tax.
    - Liability: Your personal assets are generally protected. Liability is limited to the company's assets.
    - Capital: Requires a minimum share capital of €1 (but saving towards the €25,000 required for a GmbH is encouraged).

[^3] Limited Liability Company with €25,000 Minimum Capital (GmbH)
  - What it is: The most common form of a private limited company in Germany.
  - Key Features:
    - Ownership: Can be founded by one or more people. The GmbH is a separate legal entity.
    - Taxes: Similar to the UG, it pays corporate tax, trade tax, and dividends are taxed.
    - Liability: Owners are not personally liable for the company's debts; liability is limited to the company's assets.
    - Capital: Requires a minimum share capital of €25,000, half of which must be paid up when the company is registered.

[^4] The "Freiberufler" (Freelancer) is a bit of a legal oddity and only applicable to personal service workers like doctor or accountant. Not the likes of us who sell software licenses. If in doubt, check this guide: https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe

[^5] Getting paid is another caveat. As Sole Proprietor all profit is yours and taxed as income tax. As GmbH you need to pay yourself a salary, meaning you need payroll accounting (Lohnbuchhaltung) and you have to document every salary adjustment with a signed paper. It sounds silly, but you have to literally write it down and then sign it twice, once as managing director and then as employee.

[^6] Suing works by asking for damages. If your damages are $8, the lawyer will dismiss you with a pitiful smile.

[^7] Based on the AOK provider at the time of writing, check out their calculator here: https://www.deine-gesundheitswelt.de/versicherung/beitragsrechner

[^8] If you pick private health insurance, make sure you pick one of the companies with legal form of "Versicherungsverein auf Gegenseitigkeit". Contrary to publicly traded insurers, they don't pay dividends and the owners are the insured people. Incentives are different there. More here: https://www.finanzberatung-bierl.de/leistungen/finanzberatung-regensburg/versicherungsverein-auf-gegenseitigkeit/ (Thank you Tobias Arweiler)

[^9] People have given me conflicting reports from "just set up an LLC" to "as complex as any other country at scale". Unfortunately, or fortunately, I have no first-hand experience with starting a company in the US.
